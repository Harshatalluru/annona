# Ad-hoc sign the macOS app bundle, then build the .dmg around the signed copy.
#
# Why this exists, in order of discovery:
#
# 1. Tauri's default leaves a *linker-signed* bundle: `Info.plist=not bound`,
#    `Sealed Resources=none`. That is fine locally and fatal once the file
#    carries a quarantine flag — macOS reports the app as **damaged** and offers
#    only "Move to Trash". Users downloading v0.1.0 hit exactly this.
#
# 2. `bundle.macOS.signingIdentity: "-"` fixes the seal and breaks the app a
#    different way: it signs *nested* binaries too, including the PyInstaller
#    sidecar. A onefile sidecar extracts its own Python.framework at runtime, and
#    that framework still carries the signature PyInstaller gave it, so the
#    loader refuses it:
#
#        Failed to load Python shared library ... mapping process and mapped
#        file (non-platform) have different Team IDs
#
#    The window opens and the daemon never starts.
#
# 3. Signing the bundle *without* `--deep` does both jobs: resources are sealed,
#    and the sidecar keeps the self-consistent signature PyInstaller produced.
#    Verified: `codesign --verify --strict` passes, Gatekeeper's verdict becomes
#    the recoverable "rejected" (unidentified developer) rather than an invalid
#    signature, and the daemon comes up.
#
# The .dmg is then built here rather than by Tauri, because Tauri creates the
# .app and the .dmg in one pass — there is no point in between at which the
# bundle can be signed.
#
# 4. The updater archive has to be rebuilt after signing, and this is not
#    optional. `tauri build` writes `Annona.app.tar.gz` from the bundle *as it
#    was when it bundled it* — which, on the ad-hoc path, is before this script
#    signs anything. Shipping that archive means every auto-update delivers the
#    unsigned, unsealed bundle: the "damaged, move to Trash" state that step 1
#    exists to prevent, reintroduced through the update channel where nobody
#    would look for it. So the archive is repacked from the signed app and
#    re-signed with the updater key.
#
#    With a real Developer ID (APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY set), Tauri signs during
#    the build and its own archive is already correct — the repack is harmless
#    there, and it keeps one code path instead of two.

#   fails minutes later, from a service, with a message about credentials that
#   reads as if the account were wrong.
#
# APPLE_API_KEY_P8 holds the key's contents, because a GitHub secret is a
