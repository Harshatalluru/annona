"""The link: this machine as an executor for Agents Studio, dialling out only.

ADR 0006 is the argument; this module is the runner half of it. Three things
are worth knowing before reading the code.

**Nothing listens.** Every connection is opened from here, to one endpoint the
operator typed, over HTTPS. The machine that holds the material exposes no port
for this feature, which is what makes it acceptable on a DGX behind a corporate
firewall.

**The credential is the machine's, not a person's.** It is traded once for a
single-use enrollment code an org admin created, stored in ``link.json`` with
mode ``0600``, and revoked from Studio. It can heartbeat, claim a job addressed
to this runner, and report on a job it holds. Nothing else.

**What goes back is a policy decision.** Studio is a destination outside the
machine, so a job's answer is egress. It is released only when the run's working
set, its seal and the answer's own text all sit at or below ``link.release`` in
the policy — or at or below the ``link.endpoints`` entry for the endpoint this
machine enrolled to, when there is one (ADR 0007). Otherwise the job is reported
``withheld``: Studio learns the job finished and where it was placed, and the
answer stays here — in the inbox, ``$ANNONA_HOME/link/inbox``, readable with
``annona link show``. A policy with no ``link:`` section releases nothing but
that metadata.

**Studio names a skill, never writes one.** The heartbeat lists the skills this
policy enables; a job may name one, and it is loaded before the first turn
through the same ``skill`` tool a model would call — same permission, same pin,
same ledger entry. A name the policy does not enable fails the job.
