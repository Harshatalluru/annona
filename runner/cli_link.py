"""``annona link``: offer this machine to Agents Studio as an executor.

Four commands, because the link has four states a person needs to act on:
not enrolled (``enroll``), enrolled and idle (``status``), serving (``serve``),
and done with it (``forget``). Two more read what stayed here: ``inbox`` lists
the withheld answers, ``show`` prints one. The design is ADR 0006.
