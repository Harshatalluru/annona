# Draft an 8D report

An 8D is read by the customer who complained and by the auditor who comes after
them. Both check the same thing: that every statement can be traced to a record,
and that "what we did to stop the bleeding" was never presented as "why it bled".

## Method

1. **Read everything first**: the complaint, the test and yield logs, the
   inspection records, the meeting notes. An 8D written in reading order
   inherits the order the files were listed in.
2. **Collect facts**, one per line, each with its source: what failed, where,
   when, how many, how it was detected. A figure from a meeting note is a
   figure someone said, and is marked as such.
3. **Fill the disciplines** from those facts only:
   - **D0** — symptom and any emergency response already taken;
   - **D1** — the team, as named in the documents;
   - **D2** — the problem description: what, where, when, how many, and what
     is *not* affected;
   - **D3** — containment: what was done to protect the customer now, with
     dates and quantities;
   - **D4** — root cause, for occurrence and for escape (why it happened, why
     it was not caught), each with the evidence that supports it;
   - **D5** — permanent corrective actions proposed, each tied to a D4 cause;
   - **D6** — implementation and verification, only where records show it;
   - **D7** — prevention: what changes in process, FMEA or control plan;
   - **D8** — closure and recognition, left for the team to complete.
4. **List the open questions**: every discipline that the documents do not
   support is left open with what would close it — a measurement, a record, a
   person to ask.

## Output

```
8D DRAFT · <complaint reference> · <date of the latest source>

D0  <line> · <source>
D1  <name, role> · <source>
D2  <line> · <source>
    NOT AFFECTED: <line> · <source>
D3  CONTAINMENT
    <action, date, quantity> · <source>
D4  ROOT CAUSE — OCCURRENCE
    <cause> · evidence: <source> · status: confirmed | suspected
    ROOT CAUSE — ESCAPE
    <cause> · evidence: <source> · status: confirmed | suspected
D5  <action> · addresses: <D4 cause>
D6  <action, verification> · <source>   (or OPEN)
D7  <change> · <source>                 (or OPEN)
D8  OPEN — for the team

OPEN QUESTIONS
  - <discipline> · <what is missing> · <what would close it>
CONFLICTS
  - <two sources that disagree, and on what>
```

## Rules

- Nothing is asserted without a source. A sentence you cannot trace to a
  document goes to OPEN QUESTIONS, not into a discipline.
- Containment is not root cause. Sorting parts, adding an inspection or
  replacing a probe card stops the symptom; it goes in D3 and never in D4.
- A root cause is "suspected" until a record shows it was verified — by
  reproduction, by measurement, or by the defect disappearing after the fix.
- Keep the documents' own wording for defect names and part numbers; do not
  translate a customer's failure description into your own diagnosis.
- This is a draft for the quality engineer who signs it. Do not assign blame to
  people, and do not commit the organisation to dates the documents do not give.
